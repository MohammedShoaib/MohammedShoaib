### Hi, I'm Shoaib ðŸ‘‹

I'm pursuing my Master's in Computer Science at UC Irvine. Iâ€™m currently working as an Engineering intern at [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/energy) in the Energy Team. [This talk covers the work we do](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/tesla-vpp/). Prior to my Master's I worked as a Senior Software Engineer at [Newfold Digital](https://newfold.com/).

I have experience in building backend applications following best practices of scalability, availability and reliability. I also have experience in building the infrastructure of these services. Having dabbled in both fields has resulted in me gathering sufficient hindsight to get the best of both worlds. It has made me realize that true software engineering doesn't have any titles you fit in or a domain you're bound by, It's about solving problems and leveraging the right tools to solve them.

Working at Newfold Digital has led to an exponential increase in my learning curve while providing me exposure to a wide range of problems we see in the industry. This experience is coming in handy during my internship at Tesla wherein I get to work on projects of massive scale. Every day is day zero at Tesla as I'm learning new things while unlearning a few more.
