### Hi, I'm Shoaib ðŸ‘‹

I'm pursuing my Master's in Computer Science at UC Irvine. Iâ€™m currently working as an Engineering intern at [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/energy) in the Energy Team. [This talk covers the work we do](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/tesla-vpp/). Prior to my Master's I worked as a Senior Software Engineer at [Newfold Digital](https://newfold.com/)

I consider myself as a Backend Engineer, however I have extensive SRE experience too. Having dabbled in both fields has resulted in me gathering sufficient hindsight to get the best of both worlds. It has led to working with the best developers and SREs while exchanging ideas, coding conventions, infrastructure patterns and shell scripting(*yes, I learnt a lot of shell working with SREs and I consider that as a powerful tool*)

My past experience evolves from maintaining legacy monolithic systems, to building new microservices from scratch, to building the cloud infrastructure in AWS, to scaling it to the next million users, to automating it all. Working at Newfold Digital has led to an exponential increase in my learning curve while providing me exposure to a wide range of problems we see in the industry. This experience is coming in handy during my internship at Tesla wherein I get to work on projects of massive scale. Every day is day zero at Tesla as I'm learning new things while unlearning a few more.
